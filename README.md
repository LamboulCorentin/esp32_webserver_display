# esp32_webserver_display
Esp32 web server with Ajax request to display values from esp32 ADC 

I'm trying in this project to send data from the ADC of the ESP32 at a rate of 4ms, on 8 channels of 24bits.
The main issue actualy is that the display on the HTML web server is too slow : I don't know yet if it is the XMLHttpRequest or the HTML 
webserver or the arduino code that is too slow.

I'd love too have some help, this project is helping a bigger project for EEG signal processing.
